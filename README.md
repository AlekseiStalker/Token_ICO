# Token_ICO
Smart contract for creating a token and implementation of ICO.

---------------------------------------------------------------
(This is my experience on a solidity Smart contract, dated in the spring of 2017. This contract is not a sample of the standard and contains a lot of strange logic, but still it's interesting to watch my progress, so I'll post it as my first works.)
//-------------------------
 
Smart contract contains such contracts as Ownable.sol, ERC20Basic.sol like inteface contract (they are also the standard ERC179) and StrandardToken.sol, which contains the implementation of this standard.

The basic logic is contained in the contract TokenICO.sol
